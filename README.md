# Gymulator
Gymulator is a personal project of mine in which I'm implementing various Gymnasium scenarios on topics of my own interest. It uses Pygame and Pymunk to implement user interactions and accurate physical simulation.
## Features and Contents
- A short auxiliary python script for training and testing scenarios. (WIP)
- The class structure and an initial scenario for landing the first stage of a rocket on a pad. This is based on space-x's falcon 9 booster. (Also WIP).
